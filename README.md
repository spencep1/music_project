you need to add two .env files.
One in the server that contains two variables<br>
NODE_CLIENT_ID, the spotify client id<br>
NODE_CLIENT_SECRET, the spotify client secret<br>
<br>
One in the react interface<br>
VITE_SERVER_URL, the url where you are running the server, default would be http://localhost:2999
